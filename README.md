# AIDI-1002-Final-Project
## Project Description

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems, economies, and societies worldwide. Rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 cases is crucial to contain the spread of the virus, allocate medical resources efficiently, and implement targeted public health measures. Consequently, the development of reliable diagnostic tools has become a top priority for researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers.Traditional diagnostic methods, such as PCR tests, have their limitations in terms of accuracy, cost, and turnaround time. Technology, particularly artificial intelligence, has significantly impacted various aspects of life, including healthcare. Early detection is crucial in preventing the spread of COVID-19. With the abundance of COVID-19 data, machine learning algorithms can be used to predict and detect the virus accurately. This project compares different machine learning algorithms and develops a predictive model to determine if a person has COVID-19.
